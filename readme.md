Geography Bee Quiz game tests your knowledge about the world around us. When your start the quiz, user is given one question and 4 choices of answers. You have 30 seconds to start selecting your correct answer. If you answer it right, it gives you a message that you have answered correct and a short video plays. I hide the timer and play the video in the same position. I am using an external plugin for circle timer(customized according to my requirements such as time expired event, stop/start/reset timer) and iframe for showing youtube videos. If user answers it wrong, it displays the correct answer and starts the video. Suppose if the user is not able to answer within that 30sec, the timer expires and correct answer is displayed along with the video. The onclick event is disabled once the user has selected the answer and when the video is playing to avoid selection of answer again. User has 10 questions to answer. After answering the 10th question, user is shows the total score for the quiz. He/She has the option to Restart the game. The game resets and user can start over.
